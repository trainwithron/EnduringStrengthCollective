// must say ok = true) and the APPLY file (begin ... commit, so it is all or nothing). Nothing in them searches existing text.
//   node scripts/build-paste-files.mjs
// scripts/sql-tests/paste-files.test.mjs applies every step in order on the live-equivalent schema and checks each precheck is true first.
