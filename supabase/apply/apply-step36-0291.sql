-- STEP 36: 0291 booking and credit closures: a booking, a waiting-list place or a weekly schedule must name a coach who coaches that group, a client cannot cancel or move a session that has already started or been marked attended, and the nightly credit expiry becomes one locked step that takes only an amount
--
-- Run apply-precheck first (every row ok = true). Then paste THIS file and run it once.
-- WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: "Success. No rows returned."
-- AFTERWARDS: Nothing changes for normal use. A coach can no longer put a booking on another coach's calendar, and a client can no longer spend one group's credit on another coach's calendar. A client who tries to cancel or move a session that has started (or that the coach marked attended) is told to ask their coach; cancelling or moving a future session works as before and a coach is never refused. The nightly expiry (code in the same release) now takes off only what is truly unused (sessions booked ahead or not yet marked are kept) and does it in one locked step; until the new code is live the old job still runs as before. Run after step 35.
-- ON ERROR: it is all or nothing, so nothing was applied. Run   rollback;   once, copy the red error text, and send it back. Do not run the file again.
-- It contains no text searching, so editor re-indenting cannot break it.

-- migration 0291_release_f_booking_guards.sql
-- ====================================================================================================

-- Release F, part 2: booking closures from the Assistant's Oct 7 audit (r2_03a H1 and M3).
--
-- 1. book_session, join_booking_waitlist and create_recurring_booking_series trusted the coach id the caller sent. They never checked that this coach
--    actually coaches the group the booking is for (request_booking already did). Any coach could put a booking on another coach's calendar (including one that
--    coach cannot cancel), and a client could spend one group's credit on another coach's calendar. All three now refuse unless the coach is a coach of the group.
--    The weekly-series function checks first, so it never leaves an empty series row behind.
-- 2. A client could cancel or move a session that had already started, or one the coach had already marked attended, and cancel got the credit back. For the
--    client (not the coach) both now refuse: "this session has already started, ask your coach". A coach is never refused, and cancelling a future session
--    works exactly as before.
-- 3. The nightly credit-expiry job zeroed a whole balance, including sessions already booked ahead or delivered and not yet marked (the client then read "Owed"),
--    in three separate writes that could stop half way. expire_session_credit_balance() takes off an AMOUNT (the job works out how much is truly unused) in one
--    locked step: the balance, the ledger row and the expiry record together, only if the balance is still what the job read. Server only.
-- NOT in this migration (Ron's decision): making a self-booking obey the coach's open hours and a maximum length.
-- Needs 0278/0279 (booking mode) and 0288 (overlap guard). Re-runnable.
