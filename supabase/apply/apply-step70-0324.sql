-- STEP 70: 0324 AI builder safety: a program the AI builds is a draft (not active, not seen by any client) until the coach signs it off; no path can make an unsigned draft live, and a copy of a draft is a draft

-- Run apply-precheck first (every row ok = true). Then paste THIS file and run it once.
-- WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE: "Success. No rows returned."
-- AFTERWARDS: Nothing changes for any existing program. Programs the AI builds from now on are saved as drafts and only go live when the coach presses Sign off and make active.
-- ON ERROR: it is all or nothing, so nothing was applied. Run   rollback;   once, copy the red error text, and send it back. Do not run the file again.
-- It contains no text searching, so editor re-indenting cannot break it.

-- Stage 1 of the AI builder: nothing AI-built goes live until the coach signs it off.
--
--   * programs.ai_draft: true for a program the AI built that the coach has not yet signed off. The builder now saves AI programs as drafts (not active, not seen by any client).
--   * A guard: a program can never be active while it is still an unsigned draft. Signing off is ONE update that clears ai_draft and sets is_active (the coach's "Sign off and make active"),
--     so no screen, copy, assignment or webhook can make an unsigned draft live, even by mistake.
--   * duplicate_program (the copy made by Assign, bulk assign, package enrolment and the Stripe webhook) copies ai_draft and makes the copy active only if the source was signed off. A copy of a
--     draft is a draft. The rest of the function is the live text, unchanged.
-- Nothing changes for any existing program (every row starts with ai_draft = false). Requires 0318.
