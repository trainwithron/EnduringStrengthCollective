-- FIX 2: the first person a program is assigned to gets the ORIGINAL; everyone after gets their own copy (Ron, asked four times: "first person gets the original").
-- Same function as 0337 (word for word: every check, the move of workouts, exercises, notes and progressions, is_active and the start date), with the attach condition widened from "a one-on-one
-- space or an inactive program" to also cover an active program in a group with no clients yet, and narrowed by two rules:
--   * not once anyone has a copy of it (then it is the template the copies came from, and stays one);
--   * never a template with slots (a slot is filled per client, so a template is always copied).
-- Requires 0337. Replaces one function; nothing else changes.
